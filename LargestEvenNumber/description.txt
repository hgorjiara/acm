As usual Babul is back with his problem but this time with numbers. In his problem there is a number P(always a whole number) with N digits. Now he started finding out the largest possible even number formed by rearranging this N digit number. For example consider number 1324, after rearranging the digits the largest even number possible is 4312.

Note: In case the number does not contain any even digit then output the largest odd number possible.

Input:
The first line of input will contain an integer T which is the number of testcases. Each of the next T lines will contain a number P.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print the required result.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 1000

Example:
Input:
5
1324
3415436
1023422
03517
3555

Output:
4312
6543314
4322210
75310
5553
